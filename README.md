# review-summarization
A review summarizer was developed using a deep learning model that leveraged transfer learning techniques on the pretrained BERT model. The model was trained on the Amazon Fine Food Review dataset from Kaggle, and the implementation was done using the TensorFlow framework. The summarization model, along with other text mining results such as WordCloud, sentiment analysis, and sentiment-specific summarization, was deployed as a web application and API endpoint using the Flask framework.
